            <h3>Medical Pager Chat Application, September 2021 - December 2021</h3>
                <p>
                    This is a Medical Pager Chat Application where doctors and patients can signup and work doctors and the patient can login and can chat in there we can see even the status of the user by green dot for online and red dot for offline we can send text and images there. This is a initial step we can add more onto it as we develop. We can create more chatrooms. We can have the feature of adding users to the newly created chatrooms. The credentials will be stored in a database.
                    
                </p> 
            <h3>Online Material Sharing Application, April 2021 - July 2021</h3>
                    <p>This is a online application where we can store any type of content as materials. In this project there is also authentication and authorization feature where teachers can upload and edit the contents, and students can only view the contents only if the teacher allow us to do so.</p>
            <h3>A mini blockchain model, February 2023 - March 2023</h3>
            <p>
                The blockchain can be used by government officials to store transaction data, which in turn helps farmers to demonstrate their financial history to banks and other financial organisations. This is significant because at the moment, only paper ledgers which are susceptible to loss or destruction over time are used to keep transaction data. I developed a private blockchain network that offers extensive control over transaction data using the Proof of Authority (PoA) consensus process and applications like Ganache and Truffle.
